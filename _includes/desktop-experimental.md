On the **Experimental features** tab, you have the option to allow feature flags, which are features that Docker is currently experimenting with. This is switched on by default.

These features are intended for testing and feedback only as they may change between releases without warning or remove them entirely from a future release. Docker does not offer support for experimental features. .
