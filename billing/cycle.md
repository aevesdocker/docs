You can pay for a Personal, Pro, or Team subscription on a monthly or yearly billing cycle.

If you currently have a monthly billing cycle, you can choose to switch to an annual billing cycle. 

When you change the billing cycle's duration, the subscription moves to the new billing cycle on the next billing date. To check the billing date, see [FAQs](faqs.md).
