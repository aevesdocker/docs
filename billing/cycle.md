You can pay for your personal account or organization's subscription on a monthly or yearly billing cycle.

When you change the billing cycle's duration, your subscription is moved to your new billing cycle on your next billing date. To check your billing date, see [FAQs](faqs.md).

To change your billing cycle:

1. ## Switch from a monthly subscription to an annual subscription

To upgrade from a monthly subscription to an annual subscription:

1. Log into your [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"} account as an organization owner or with your personal account.
2. Open the drop-down menu next to your username in the top-right corner and select **Billing**.
3. Select your personal account or organization from the left-hand menu and select the **Payment Methods** tab.
4. Select **switch to annual billing**
5. Review the information displayed on the **Change to an Annual subscription** page and select **Accept Terms and Purchase** to confirm.

You can view the confirmation of the upgrade with an invoice containing details about your new subscription, entitlements, and the total cost on the **Billing** page.
