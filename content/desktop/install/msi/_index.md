Docker offers a 64-bit Microsoft Installer (MSI) package designed to assist IT administrators in customizing and deploying Docker Desktop across multiple users or machines. 

This MSI package is compatible with Microsoft Configuration Manager and other third-party distribution software, facilitating streamlined, bulk deployments. Such deployments eliminate the need for individual users to manually download and install Docker Desktop. Instead, it is installed and automatically launched the first time a developer signs in to their machine, simplifying the setup process.
