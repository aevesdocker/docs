Docker provide a 64-bit Microsoft installer (MSI) package to help IT Administrators customize and bulk deploy Docker Desktop for multiple users or machines. MSI files can be used with Microsoft Endpoint Configuration or third-party distribution software. 
Bulk deployments are useful because users don't need to download and install Docker Desktop manually. Rather, It will be deployed to their machines and then auto-launch the first time users sign into a computer.
