Docker Desktop is an easy-to-install, lightweight Docker development environment. Docker Desktop is available for [Mac](#docker-desktop-for-mac), [Windows](#docker-desktop-for-windows), and [Linux](#docker-desktop-for-linux), providing developers a consistent experience across platforms. Docker Desktop includes Docker Engine, Docker CLI client, Docker Compose, Docker Content Trust, Kubernetes, and Credential Helper.

Docker Desktop works with your choice of development tools and languages and gives you access to a vast library of certified images and templates in Docker Hub. This enables development teams to extend their environment to rapidly auto-build, continuously integrate, and collaborate using a secure repository.
