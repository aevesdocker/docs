Auditing and Monitoring User Activity
Regular monitoring of user activity is essential for maintaining a secure Docker environment. Docker Business provides audit logs and activity tracking to help you identify potential issues.

Using Audit Logs
Access logs from the Admin Console to track changes in user roles, team assignments, and resource permissions.
Filter logs by date, user, or action type to pinpoint specific events.
Identify unusual patterns, such as frequent role changes or unauthorized resource access attempts.
