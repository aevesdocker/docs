Profiles help you adjust your Compose application for different environments or usecases by selectively activating services. Services can be assigned to one or more profiles; unassigned services start by default, while assigned ones only start when their profile is active. This setup allows for specific services, like those for debugging or development, to be included in a single `compose.yml` file and activated only as needed.
