Docker provides security guardrails for both administrators and developers. 

If you are an administrator, you can enforce sign in across Docker products for your developers, and 
scale, manage, and secure your instances of Docker Desktop with DevOps security controls like Enhanced Container Isolation and Registry Access Management. 

For developers, Docker provides security-specific products such as Docker Scout, for securing your software supply chain with proactive image vulnerability monitoring and remediation strategies.
