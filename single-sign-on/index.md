This section is for administrators who want to enable Single Sign-on (SSO) for their business. SSO allows users to authenticate using their identity providers (IdPs)  to access Docker. You can enable SSO for either a company or organization(s) that are part of the Docker Business subscription. To upgrade your existing account to a Docker Business subscription, see [Upgrade your subscription](../subscription/upgrade/){:target="blank" rel="noopener" class=""}.

## How it works

When SSO is enabled, users are redirected to your providerâ€™s authentication page to sign in. They cannot authenticate using their Docker login credentials  (Docker ID and password). Docker currently supports Service Provider Initiated SSO flow. Your users must sign in to Docker Hub or Docker Desktop to initiate the SSO authentication process.

The following diagram shows how SSO operates and is managed in Docker Hub and Docker Desktop. In addition, it provides information on how to authenticate between your IdPs.

## How to set it up

Before enabling SSO in Docker Hub, administrators must first configure their identity provider to work with Docker Hub. Docker provides the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL and the Entity ID. Administrators use this information to establish a connection between their IdP server and Docker Hub.

After establishing the connection between the IdP server and Docker Hub, administrators sign in to the organization in Docker Hub and complete the SSO enablement process. 

Administrators can then choose to enforce SSO login and effortlessly manage SSO connections for their individual Docker organizations or company.
