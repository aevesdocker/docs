### I want to buy a large number of Docker Team Subscription seats. How do I do this?

Contact the [Docker Sales Team](https://goto.docker.com/pricing-question.html){:target="blank" rel="noopener" class=""} to buy a larger number of Docker Team Subscription seats.

### How do I access support? Do I have any extra benefits?

### Does Docker offer academic pricing?

Contact the [Docker Sales Team](https://www.docker.com/company/contact){:target="blank" rel="noopener" class=""}.

### Do I need to do anything at the end of my subscription term?

No. All monthly and annual subscriptions are automatically renewed at the end of the term using the original form of payment.

### What happens if I pay for an annual subscription and add more users later?

When you add seats to your plan in the middle of your billing cycle, a prorated amount will be charged for the additional seats.

### How do downgrades from a Pro or Team plan work?
When you downgrade your Pro or Team plan, changes are applied at the end of your billing cycle. For example, if you are currently on a Team plan which is billed on the 8th of every month and you choose to downgrade to a Free Team plan on the 15th, your Team plan will be active until 7th of the following month. You will be transferred to a Free Team plan on the 8th of the following month. Please refer to the next two questions below for instructions on how to downgrade your account.

### How do I downgrade from a Team plan to a Free Team plan?

Before you downgrade to a Free plan, ensure that your organization details are updated to reflect features available in the Free plan. For example, you may need to reduce the number of team members and convert any private repositories to public repositories. For information on what’s included in the Free plan, see the [billing](index.md){:target="blank" rel="noopener" class=""} page.

### How do I downgrade from Pro to a Free plan?

Before you downgrade to a Free plan, ensure that your account organization details are updated to reflect features available in the Free plan. For example, you may need to convert any private repositories to public repositories. For information on what’s included in the Free plan, see the [billing](downgrade.md){:target="blank" rel="noopener" class=""} page.

### How do I add a member to a team in my organization?

For information on how to add a member to a team, see [Add a member to a team](../docker-hub/members.md#add-a-member-to-a-team){:target="blank" rel="noopener" class=""}.

### What happens to my collaborators when I move to a free individual plan?

Free individual plans do not include collaborators for private repositories. If you have collaborators when you move to a free individual plan either from a paid plan or another free plan then you are required to remove all collaborators. If collaborators have not been removed within 30 days of moving to a free plan, all collaborators will automatically be removed from your account.

### What happens to my team members when I move to a free team plan?

Free team plans are allowed up to 3 members. If your team has more than three members when you move to a free team plan either from a paid plan or another free plan you are required to reduce your members to three. If your team size has not not been reduced to three within 30 days of moving to a free plan, all members will automatically be removed from your account. You will be able to add up to three members afterwards.

### How does Docker Team Subscription pricing work?

Team starts at $25 per month for the first five users and $7 per month for each user thereafter with an annual subscription discount.

### How do I know what new features are in planning for my Docker Pro or Docker Team subscription?

Docker maintains a [public roadmap](https://github.com/docker/roadmap){:target="blank" rel="noopener" class=""} so subscribers can see what new features are in development, as well as request new capabilities. New premium features will be available to you automatically as part of your migrated Docker subscription.

### I have more questions regarding the new pricing, who can I reach out to?

If you have any questions that are not covered in the FAQ, [please reach out](https://www.docker.com/company/contact){:target="blank" rel="noopener" class=""} and a member of the Docker team will get back to you.
